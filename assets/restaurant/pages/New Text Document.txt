Welcome to our Restaurant Management System project! Our project leverages cutting-edge technologies, including Spring Boot 3, Spring Security 6, Angular 16, Ng Zorro UI, and a MySQL database. Let's explore the key features of this restaurant management system:

Project Features:

Angular Modules:

Our project is structured into two Angular modules: Admin and Customer, each with its own routing files to provide a seamless user experience.

Admin Functions:

- Secure Authentication: Admin can log in to generate tokens and access authenticated APIs. We've implemented JWT authentication and authorization to ensure robust API protection.
- Category Management: Admin can effortlessly post, get, and search for categories, making menu management a breeze.
- Product Management: Admin have full control over products, with the ability to post, update, delete, get, and search for items on the menu.
- Reservation Requests: Admin can view reservation requests from customers and take action, such as approving or disapproving requests, to efficiently manage table bookings.


Customer Functions:

- Secure Authentication: Customers can log in to generate tokens and access authenticated APIs, just like admin. JWT authentication and authorization are in place to safeguard data and functionality.
- Product Browsing: Customers can explore all the products available on the menu directly from their dashboard.
- Product Search: Easily find specific products with a convenient search feature.
- Reservation Requests: Customers can initiate reservation requests to secure a dining table for a specific date and time.
- Past Reservation Requests: Customers can also access their history of reservation requests for reference.


Ng Zorro UI:
We've integrated the Ng Zorro UI library to ensure an attractive and user-friendly interface, enhancing the overall experience for both admin and customers.
